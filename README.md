Led a comprehensive funnel analysis project for an online food ordering app to optimize user journey and increase conversion rates. The analysis focused on identifying key drop-off points in the customer journey, from app launch to order completion. By leveraging data analytics tools, I tracked user interactions and behavior patterns across various stages of the funnel, including account creation, menu exploration, cart addition, and checkout processes.

Key Achievements:

Identified critical drop-off points that contributed to a 15% decrease in conversion rate.
Developed actionable insights and recommendations that led to a 20% improvement in order completions.
Collaborated with product and marketing teams to implement targeted interventions such as streamlined checkout processes, personalized offers, and UX enhancements.
Utilized tools like Google Analytics, SQL, and data visualization software to present findings and drive data-informed decisions.
Impact:
This project resulted in a significant increase in user retention and overall revenue growth for the app, demonstrating the power of data-driven strategies in enhancing user experience and business performance.
